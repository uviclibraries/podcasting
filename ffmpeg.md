# Installing FFMPEG
As part of your editing or publishing process, you might be asked to install FFMPEG in order to import different types of files, like .m4a or for exporting to mp3. This part of the tutorial will help you install the tools you need to do this type of importing and exporting. 

1. Please either use the audio you recorded in [Activty #1 - Podcast Recording with Audacity](recording-audio.html), or Download this [Audacity Intructions for installing FFMPEG](https://support.audacityteam.org/basics/installing-ffmpeg){:target="_blank"}, and then proceed to step 2 below.



<script>  

    function toggle(input) {
        var x = document.getElementById(input);
        if (x.style.display === "none") {
            x.style.display = "block";
        } else {
            x.style.display = "none";
        }
    }
</script>
